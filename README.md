# Oro--Guide-to-isolating-a-gpu-for-gpu-passthrough
A guide I made to show how to isolate a GPU for passing it through to a virtual machine. May or may not work for you

I intended to make this guide for in the future when I need to isolate a gpu, but anybody can feel free to use this. 
Afterwards, I will also include a guide for how to add it to a virtual machine.
